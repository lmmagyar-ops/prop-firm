# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### Is this a scam?
No. We are the world's first prediction market-based prop firm. We provide capital for traders to trade on Polymarket and Kalshi. You keep 80-90% of profits (depending on if you buy the profit split upgrade). It's a legitimate business model used by hundreds of prop firms in forex/futures - we're just the first to do it for prediction markets.

### Do I risk my own money?
No. You pay a one-time evaluation fee ($79/$149/$299 depending on tier), but you never risk your own capital during trading. All positions are funded by us. Your only cost is the evaluation fee, which is refunded with your first payout if you pass.

### What if I lose?
Your evaluation ends when you hit the drawdown limit. The challenge fee is non-refundable if you fail. You can purchase a new evaluation when you're ready. Many of our successful traders failed 2-3 times before getting funded - it's part of the learning process.

### How do you make money if challenges are refundable?
We make money from the profit split when you succeed (20% base, or 10% if you bought the upgrade). Our model is built on trader success, not trader failure. The more you profit, the more we profit. Failed evaluation fees also help cover operational costs.

## Pricing & Tiers

### Which tier should I choose?
**Most traders start with the 10k Grinder tier ($149)**. It offers the best balance of capital size and cost. If you're completely new to prediction markets, start with the 5k Scout tier ($79). Experienced traders who want maximum capital choose the 25k Executive tier ($299).

### Is the evaluation fee refundable?
Yes, IF you pass the evaluation and request a funded account. Your evaluation fee is fully refunded with your first payout. So if you pay $149 for the 10k tier and make $1,000 profit, you'll receive $800 (80% split) + $149 (fee refund) = $949 total. If you fail the challenge, the fee is non-refundable.

### Can I buy multiple evaluations?
Yes. You can run multiple evaluations simultaneously. Many traders run 2-3 accounts at once to diversify across different markets and strategies.

### What's the 90% profit split upgrade?
By default, you keep 80% of profits. You can purchase a 90% profit split upgrade (as an add-on) to keep 90% instead. The cost varies - check checkout for current pricing.

## Trading Rules

### What markets can I trade?
Only Polymarket and Kalshi prediction markets. This includes politics, sports, economics, crypto, entertainment, and all other categories on these platforms. We do NOT support other platforms or traditional assets.

### Can I use leverage?
No. All positions are 1:1 (no leverage). This is a platform limitation on Polymarket and Kalshi, not ours.

### Is there a daily loss limit?
Yes. You cannot lose more than your tier's daily loss limit in a single trading day:
- Scout (5k): 4% daily loss limit ($200)
- Grinder (10k): 5% daily loss limit ($500)
- Executive (25k): 5% daily loss limit ($1,250)

Daily limits reset at midnight UTC. This prevents revenge trading.

### How long do I have to complete the evaluation?
There's no hard time limit. The suggested maximum is 60 days, but the only firm requirement is that you trade on at least 5 different days before passing. Take a week, a month, or longer - we don't strictly enforce time limits during evaluation.

### Can I trade during news events?
Yes. Unlike some prop firms, we have no restrictions on trading during high-impact news or events. Election nights, economic announcements, breaking news - trade whenever you want.

### What happens if I hit my drawdown limit?
Your account ends immediately and the evaluation is over. The challenge fee is non-refundable. You'll need to purchase a new evaluation to try again.

### What is the max drawdown limit?
It varies by tier:
- Scout (5k): 8% max drawdown
- Grinder (10k): 10% max drawdown  
- Executive (25k): 10% max drawdown

The drawdown is "trailing" - it's calculated from your account's highest point (high-water mark), not your starting balance.

## Payouts

### How often do you pay out?
After your first 30 days in a funded account, payouts are bi-weekly (every 14 days). The first month has a 30-day payout cycle to allow for operational setup.

### What payment methods do you support?
- USDC (stablecoin) - preferred
- PayPal for fiat
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Confirmo or Moonpay for crypto processing

Processing time is 1-3 business days.

### Is there a minimum payout amount?
Yes. $100 minimum. You can request payouts as often as bi-weekly cycles allow, as long as you meet the $100 minimum.

### Do you charge withdrawal fees?
Network fees apply for crypto payouts (standard blockchain transaction costs). PayPal may have their own fees. We don't add our own withdrawal fees on top.

### What's the payout cap?
- **Scout (5k) & Grinder (10k)**: Unlimited
- **Executive (25k)**: $2,000 cap on your FIRST payout only, then unlimited after that

## Comparison to Other Firms

### How is this different from other prop firms?
1. **Markets**: We're the only firm offering prediction markets (Polymarket/Kalshi). Others only do futures/forex.
2. **Fair Loss Limits**: We have daily loss limits (4-5%) and trailing drawdowns (8-10%).
3. **Instant Funding**: No "consistency phase" - pass and get funded immediately.
4. **Competitive Split**: 80% base profit share (90% upgrade available) vs 70-80% at most firms.

### Why prediction markets instead of futures?
Prediction markets are less correlated to traditional markets, offer unique alpha opportunities from news/events, and don't require technical analysis skills. Plus, you can profit from your knowledge of politics, sports, and current events - not just chart patterns.

## Platform & Technical

### What is Polymarket? What is Kalshi?
**Polymarket**: Decentralized prediction market platform. You bet on real-world events (elections, sports, economics) using USDC. Markets are binary (Yes/No) and settle based on real outcomes. More volume, wild markets.

**Kalshi**: CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange. Cleaner contracts, more structured, US-based regulation. 

Both are legitimate prediction market platforms.

### Do I need my own Polymarket or Kalshi account?
No. We provide you with a funded account on your chosen platform as part of your evaluation. You trade directly through our dashboard interface, which connects to the underlying markets.

### What if the platform goes down?
Your evaluation pauses if Polymarket or Kalshi has technical issues. We don't count outages against your time or drawdown limits.

### Can I use bots or automated trading?
Not during evaluation. Once you're funded, we allow automation with prior approval. Contact support for details.

## Account Management

### Can I scale my account?
Not yet. Once you pass an evaluation, you trade that account size indefinitely. Account scaling programs are planned for 2026.

### Can I have multiple funded accounts?
Yes. Pass multiple evaluations, get multiple funded accounts. Just don't hedge between them or copy trades - that violates our fair trading policy.

### What if I want to close my account?
Yes, anytime. Just stop trading and request account closure. Any pending profits will be paid out in the next payout cycle (if you meet the $100 minimum).
