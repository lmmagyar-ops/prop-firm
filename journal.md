## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS — Read This First

### Mar 10, 2026 (8:00 AM CT) — Housekeeping Session

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Production** | ✅ Healthy — `c264d57` live |
| **Test suite** | ✅ 87 files, 1337 passed, 0 failed, 3 skipped |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md DB section** | ✅ Updated — was stale (referenced Prisma Postgres, postgres.js, db.prisma.io) |
| **Dead migration scripts** | ✅ Deleted (`migrate-data.ts`, `migrate-to-neon-direct.sh`, `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`) |
| **Vitest watch mode issue** | ✅ Diagnosed — `npm run test` hangs because Vitest defaults to watch mode. Use `npm run test -- --run` |
| **Journal pruned** | ✅ Entries older than 7 days removed |
| **Neon branching** | ✅ `develop` branch created (`ep-autumn-haze-adluhbxu`), Vercel `DATABASE_URL` scoped to Preview + `develop` |
| **Sentry TLSWrap** | ✅ Zero errors since March 8. Neon migration confirmed working |
| **Financial invariants** | ✅ Fixed fail-open bug — `hardInvariant()` now always throws on money paths (`ada65c9`) |
| **DB CHECK constraints** | ✅ 7 constraints block NaN/Infinity at Postgres level on challenges, positions, trades (`24b18e7`) |
| **NaN root cause** | ✅ Fixed `calculateImpact` 0/0 division when all order book levels have invalid price/size (`aeebe30`) |
| **Balance repair** | ✅ `a59d8d5e` corrected to `$23,663.90` (phase-aware replay). Audit: 6/6 HEALTHY |

### ⚠️ What the Next Agent Must Know

1. **Vercel plan must remain Pro.** Never downgrade to Hobby — paid commercial product.
2. **`dbPool` vs `db`:** `db` = neon-http (stateless, all reads). `dbPool` = neon-serverless WebSocket (transactions only). Any new `tx.execute()` call must access `.rows[0]`, NOT `[0]` directly.
3. **Banner fix (`2c2217f`) is UNVERIFIED by Mat** — he hasn't triggered a daily breach since the fix.
4. **`npm run test` uses Vitest watch mode.** Always run `npm run test -- --run` or `npx vitest run` to get an exit. The test script is `"test": "vitest"` (no `--run` flag).
5. **Neon branching is configured.** Preview deploys on `develop` use `ep-autumn-haze-adluhbxu` (Neon `develop` branch). Production uses `ep-royal-lab-adny4asz` unchanged.

## 🔜 Today's Priorities (ranked by leverage × risk)

### ~~PRIORITY 1 — Set Up Neon Branching for Preview Deployments~~ ✅ DONE
Neon `develop` branch created from `production`. Vercel `DATABASE_URL` scoped to Preview + `develop` branch. No auto-delete. Endpoint: `ep-autumn-haze-adluhbxu`.

### ~~PRIORITY 2 — Check Sentry for TLSWrap Error Rate~~ ✅ DONE
Zero TLSWrap errors since March 8. Last "Failed query" errors were on migration day (Mar 8, 4-64 events during transition). No connection errors since. The 581/week Prisma TCP drops are fully eliminated.

### ~~PRIORITY 3 — Verify Neon PITR Backup~~ ✅ DONE
PITR enabled, 6-hour retention window (Free plan). Restore: Neon Console → Branches → production → Backup & Restore → select timestamp. Documented in ARCHITECTURE.md.
